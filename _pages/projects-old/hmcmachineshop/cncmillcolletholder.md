title: CNC Mill Collet Holder
---

So Sean and I done goofed and ordered non-laser-cuttable material for a few shop projects (we were positive that polycarb was laser-cuttable but apparently it flames up if you try to cut it... oops). But it was substantially cheaper and more durable as opposed to the laser-cuttable stock, and shipping was rather expensive, so we decided to deal with it and machine the parts instead.

See below for an image of one of the sketchy fixturing jobs we had to do (because we were out of double-sided tape and because I didn't cut the part oversize (because I didn't realize we were out of that tape... (one more set of parentheses to bug Sean (and a smilie to make things even better :) )))).

Sketchy fixturing.

Check out [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0Jfms0twG8ENHVfRnJuUlVON00/view?usp=sharing) of the machining process. Gotta love the plastic everywhere - looks like it snowed in the shop. [This](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6O1HmBYn-U8bWhIMlVGRzJ1NVk/edit?usp=sharing)is a better video of the actual machining. We're running the mill at 5000 RPM (it's maximum speed) at 20 IPM.

Plastic everywhere...

Finally, below is a picture of the collet holder. You can't see it, but we rastered on labels for each size(rastering is using the laser-cutter to etch the surface - makes it look like frosted glass). If you ask me, the final product is way better than the previous system!

The old (left) and the new (right). One looks a bit better if you ask me...

So in the future, we're going to be more careful about what material we order, and check to see if we have all the tools we need. I don't know if you can see it, but there are also two lines we accidentally made in the material by not deburring all of our sacrificial plates. So we gotta do that better too. Learning things! Yay!
