 During my senior year, I wasÂ a member of a four personÂ HMC CS clinic team working with Qualcomm Research. We were responsible for designing and building a robotic tour guide to demonstrate the capabilities of the Snapdragon 600 processor in a mobile robotics context. At the end of the year, our modified TurtleBot2 was capable of autonomously guiding visitors through Mudd's Libra Complex - the notoriouslyÂ labyrinthine underground complex containing most of Mudd's labs.Â 

  

I was the project manager for the team and as such was responsible for keeping the whole team on track.Â 

  

I was also lead for localization and hardware modifications. In this role, I successfully generated maps of the entire environment, tuned and augmented the ROS navigation stack to allow the TurtleBot2 to navigate those maps, and modified the TurtleBot2 to work with the Snapdragon 600 and other additions.Â
