 Christopher Richards

 Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong will go wrong. 

  

  

 Hanlon's razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.Â

 When you come across information you've already read or seen, the temptation is to say, â€œI already know this.â€ Okay, you know it â€" but are you living what you know? If not, you might want to keep studying and practicing on that topic, even if you feel like you â€œknowâ€ it.Â
