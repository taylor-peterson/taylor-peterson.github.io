When I'm working on projects, I'll often run into problems which I don't know how to solve.

Ever had a moment like this during a project? Me too. 

Often, I am able to find good tutorials on the subject. In other cases, however, the resources I need are scattered about the web, the tutorials available are not very good, or I simply can't find anything. In these cases, I end up having to figure out things for myself. To help others (and myself!) avoid struggling with these topics in the future, I'll be posting tutorials for future reference. 

Some (alright, many) of these are references to Sean Messenger's site, as we will not be doing duplicate tutorials.
