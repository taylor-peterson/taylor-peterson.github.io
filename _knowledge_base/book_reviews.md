# Reading Philosophy

Unfortunately, I'm constitutionally incapable of reading (good) fiction without
becoming engrossed in the book to the point nothing else matters to me. The
characters' world becomes my own and I'd rather spend time exploring it than
my own.

As for non-fiction, I've found that I encounter the same ideas over and over.
Although this can get tedious, it generally serves instead to remind me that I
still haven't grokked and implemented them in my own life (i.e. the
knowing-doing gap). I also find books in the "self development" genre to be a
great source of motivation.

# What I Talk About When I Talk About Running - Haruki Murakami [3/5]

This memoir of a sorts was a mixed experience for me. There were parts that
resonated (e.g. Haruki's craftsman approach to life) and pieces that didn't
(e.g. his insistence that talent matters more than the focus he speaks so
much about). I also have to call out Haruki for saying he runs every day
when he also says he doesn't run when it's raining.

# Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - Robert Pirsig [3/5]

Unsurprisingly, I found the philosophical inquiries in the book far more interesting
than the accompanying narrative. That said, I enjoyed this book far less than I did
when I first read it back in high school and didn't find that there were many useful
takeaways.

That may be because I've already embraced many of Pirsig's notions of quality (which
is in many ways reminiscent of Cal Newport's writings on craftsmanship). That said,
I did relate to his discussion on gumption traps, which "can be defined as anything
that causes one to lose sight of Quality, and thus lose one's enthusiasm for what one
is doing."

# The Obstacle is the Way - Ryan Holiday [4/5]

This book leverages stories of famous leaders and entrepreneurs to introduce
Stoic ideas and inspire readers to adopt a Stoic mindset.

If you've already had exposure to said ideas and adopted (or started to adopt)
said mindset, there's not much new here. Moreover, Ryan tends to hammer home
the same point repeatedly with multiple stories and by saying the same thing
in slightly different ways. Perhaps useful for a first timer, but a bit
annoying otherwise.

Two ideas that Ryan does express very well are:
* "The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Never forget, within every
  obstacle is an opportunity to improve our condition."
* There's always another obstacle around the corner; get used to it.

# Checklist Manifesto - Atul Gawande [3/5]

So. Many. Stories. We get it, checklists are useful, but tricky to get right.
But how do we actually go about using them? Especially outside of the team
context you're considering.

Main points on why to use them:
1. make sure the minimum gets done
2. free up your mental RAM
3. instill discipline
4. save time

[Checklist checklist](http://www.projectcheck.org/checklist-for-checklists.html):
* precise
* efficient, to the point, easy to use even in difficult situations
* don't try to spell everything out
* provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps - the ones that even
  highly skilled professionals using them could miss
* make sure they are practical
* 5-9 items per pause point

Two main types of checks:
1. task checks for dumb but critical stuff
2. communication checks for complex stuff

Two main types of checklists:
1. READ-DO when have limited experience with process
2. DO-CONFIRM otherwise

# Fires of Calderon [2/5]

Not hugely original; major reveals were predictable.

# Old Man's War [3/5]

Interesting concept, but wasn't enticed into reading additional books in the series.

# So Good They Can't Ignore You - Cal Newport [3/5]

The main point of this book is that "following your passion" is bull and that
mastering rare and valuable skills is a better path to a successful and fulfilling
career. Whether you love your work or not is mostly based on expertise and experience,
so your particular career choice is much less important than leveraging deliberate
practice to become an expert.

This approach roughly mirrors my preceding outlook coming in (in part because I had
read Cal's Craftsman post several years prior). The book also does not
have much in the way of actionable takeaways, so I didn't get a ton out of it.

# Deep Work - Cal Newport [5/5]

Let's start off by defining Deep Work and its counterpart Shallow Work:
* Deep Work: activities performed in a state of distraction-free
  concentration that push your cognitive abilities to their limit. These efforts
  create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
* Shallow Work: non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often
  performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value
  in the world and are easy to replicate.

The first half of this book argues that deep work:
* Valuable: high-quality work produced = (time spent) x (intensity of focus)
* Rare: trends in business tend to decrease peoples' ability to perform deep work
  (e.g. instant messaging, open office plans).
* Meaningful: deep work is in many ways deliberate practice applied to another domain.
Despite me not focusing sufficiently on this, I was already aboard this train.
(A great article around this is http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html.)

Cal provides four options for scheduling deep work (which he recommends ritualizing):
* Monastic: isolate yourself completely until the work is finished
* Bimodal: schedule long stretches of isolation (days or weeks)
* Rhythmic: schedule time everyday for deep work (make it habitual; can't go as deep)
* Journalistic: switch to deep whenever you can

Other recommendations:
* In communication, don't send small messages back and forth - take the time to think
  things through and take care of everything possible in one go (e.g. instead of ask question
  and wait for response to follow up, say if A, then B, otherwise C)
* Productive meditation - work on a complex problem when commuting or the like.
* Deep breaks: http://calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/14/on-deep-breaks/
* "Fixed schedule productivity" - set standard hours and be strict about them,
  take downtime, and consciously decide (i.e. schedule ahead of time) when to do shallow work
* The standard "quit social media" and "don't use the internet to entertain yourself" refrains
* Embrace Boredom: to concentrate intensely, you have to ween your mind off of distractions
  (e.g. when standing in line, resist the urge to whip out your phone)

One thing that's interesting is that Cal never really talks about what he does in his
downtime.

# Peak - Anders Ericsson [5/5]

This book provides an window into the research underlying the so-called "10,000 hours" rule.
Turns out, that's a rather arbitrary number, but you'll still need thousands of hours of
high-quality practice to become an expert - "natural talent" doesn't play into it.

Levels of Practice:
1. Naive practice:
   * "just doing it"
2. Purposeful practice:
   * clear, specific goal (with small steps and a plan to get there)
   * metrics
   * focused during practice
   * constantly push comfort zone
   * immediate feedback
3. Deliberate practice:
   * purposeful practice that's guided by an expert in the field (can be indirect by
     identifying experts, figuring out what makes them so good, then basing your practice
     on that)

Mental representations are a major component of skill - this enables incredible
memory, pattern recognition, problem solving, and other advanced abilities.

# Walden - Henry David Thoreau [0/5]

I almost finished the first chapter of Thoreau's "masterpiece", Walden, before
putting the book down in disgust. Although widely regarded as a "classic"
containing influential ideas, those key ideas are better acquired from
alternate sources.

Thoreau is pretentious, privileged, judgemental, hypocritical, disingenuous,
and otherwise insufferable.

There is [an excellent article](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum)
in "The New Yorker" which goes into greater detail on "Henry David Thoreau's moral myopia."

Walden's key ideas of living simply and respecting nature would be better
picked up by reading the Stoics and spending some time in nature yourself.
