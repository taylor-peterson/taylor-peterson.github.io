During the fall semester of my junior year, I was a member of a five person HMC
clinic team working with Amazon.com. We were responsible for designing and
building a robotic quality control apparatus to verify the performance of
tablets and mobile devices by mimicking human-device touch interactions. When
the project is complete, the robot will autonomously execute programmed
commands to sub-millimeter accuracy and use image processing to recognize the
pass/fail of tests within one second of screen response.

I made contributions to overall system design, mechanical design of the motion
system, machining & assembly of the system, firmware (FPGA modules to interface
with rotary encoders), and a Python-based GUI for user interfacing.

For more information this project, please see our [Midyear
Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0Jfms0twG8EM3V4OFRPNWNuNUE/edit?usp=sharing),
which details some of the progress we made during the semester. Note that
additional work was done on the image processing and user interface subsystems
after this report was completed.
