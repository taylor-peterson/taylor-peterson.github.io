# Overview

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science from [Harvey Mudd College](www.hmc.edu)
in May 2015 with a double major in Computer Science and Enginerring and a 3.7 GPA.

# Why Double Major?

In the fall of our sophomore year, Sean Messenger and I started discussing what
we wanted to major in. We had both come into Mudd expecting to be engineers,
but Mudd's intro computer science course convinced us that CS was something we
were very interested in. Taking the next course in the computer science
sequence only increased that interest. We were officially hooked. This dual
interest in engineering and CS made it difficult to decide which major to
pursue.

In the end, it was our focus on robotics that enabled us to make our decision.
Sean had come into Mudd already interested in robotics (and with a hefty FIRST
Robotics background). Meanwhile, I became involved with robotics with
Autonomous Vehicles (E11) during my freshman year. Both of us had been involved
in robotics since (taking a number of courses in the subject, working in a
robotics research lab, and pursuing robotics-related side projects). So we knew
that whatever major we decided on, our coursework had to prepare us for a
career in robotics.

To that end, we decided to figure out what courses would most benefit us, then
revisit the major decision. Given that robotics draws heavily from both CS and
engineering, we knew that we were going to end up taking a large number of
courses from both departments. In order to figure out which courses in each
major would be most relevant, we started talking to professors and other
students.  After many hours of meetings with professors (and discussions with
older students), we realized that we were going to end up taking all but one or
two courses in either major, regardless of which choice we selected.

Being us, we decided to take on those two extra courses and become full-fledged
Engineering and Computer Science majors.

We've found our double major to be highly beneficial. There have been many
occasions where our engineering background has allowed us to solve problems
which were stumping our CS compatriots, and vice versa. Moreover, we've both
found ourselves more at home on the Computer Science side of things. Given
that we were only really considering Engineering or both, and how the Computer
Science degree has been essential, the double has worked out well for us.

Despite the extra workload, we also remained on top of our studies and did
extremely well in both majors. Most people (okay, everyone) said we were crazy
for pursuing both degrees. But we learned more than we would have otherwise and
loved what we were doing. If that's crazy, then that's fine by us.

That all said, the double major is not something we would recommend. If you're
in the same boat, take all the courses in each that interest you, then make a
decision.
