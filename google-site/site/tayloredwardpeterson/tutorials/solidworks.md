More content will be added soon, but for now, here are some quick thoughts:

- Naming should generally not have the version in it. That goes as a property field in the file itself.
- Hole wizard takes a bit of getting used to but is helpful
- Mirror whenever possible (and use the related symmetry)
- Stick to ISO standards
- Shortcuts are your friend (M for measure, D for dimension, C for constrain, and so on). Saves time.
- Use cosmetic threads over actually threading the part - it will make rebuilding and simulation faster
- To make a plane offset from another plane by a set angle, use the define geometry feature and select the plane to offset from and the axis of revolution
- When possible, use a revolved boss/base to start off the part
- Define features relative to a set origin. This makes future edits easier and is what you will want to show in drawings.
