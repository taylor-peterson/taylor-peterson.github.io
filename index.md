Welcome!

If this is your first time visiting, here are some suggestions on how to use
this site:

* If you're just browsing, you're probably not reading this. But if you are,
hit on the breakout pages for [Research](/research) and any of the
[Projects](/projects) you might be interested in. Those pages contain quick
overviews (and pretty pictures). If anything piques your interest, delve deeper
into the project.
* If you're looking for information on something specific or
want to get a better sense for how I work, check out the
[Tutorials](/tutorials) and [build logs](/projects). If you don't see what
you're looking for, but think I can help, shoot me an email. (See [About
Me](/about-me) for contact info.)

I started up this site for several reasons. In no particular order, they are:

* Many projects I've worked on (both individually and as part of a team) have
  lacked comprehensive documentation. Pictures, schematics, design rationale,
  etc. have been scattered about (or never written down!). In response to this,
  I'll be posting detailed build logs for all of my projects going forward (and
  have done my best to compile information on prior work).
* I'm frequently asked questions like "What have you been up to?" and "How are
  things going?" by friends and family. While I still have (and enjoy) these
  conversations, this site makes it a lot easier  to keep them in the loop.
* By putting a large portion of my work up on the web, I open myself up for
  external review. This transparency and accountability serve as an excellent
  motivator and source of feedback.
* I've come to realize that I can't possibly fit everything I want to
  on my r©sum©, so this site will serve as a portfolio for employers.

Throughout the site, you'll see a large number of links and references to Sean
Messenger and his [site](https://sites.google.com/site/raintomudd/). The reason
for this is simple: since we decided to pursue a double major in Engineering
and Computer Science during our sophomore year at Mudd, we've been pretty much
inseparable. We've taken virtually all the same courses (with each other) and
partnered together on almost every project either of us has undertaken since
then. Sean's been called "my other half" more than once for good reason.

Feel free to contact me with questions or suggestions. (See [About
Me](/about*me) for contact info.)

Please note that the postings on this site are my own and don't necessarily
represent my employer's position.
