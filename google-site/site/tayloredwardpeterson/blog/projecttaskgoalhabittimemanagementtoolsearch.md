# Project/Task/Goal/Habit/Time Management Tool Search

## Overview:

## I tend to use the following tools:

1. File Hosting - Google Drive
2. Version Control - Git(Hub)
3. Meeting Notes/Documentation - Google Drive/WikiDot/Google Sites
4. Task Management - Google Tasks (in Google Calendar sidebar)
5. Time Management - Google Calendar
6. Code Review - GitHub (or equivalent)
7. Habit Tracking: HabitBull

 One perk of using a lot of Google products is how easy it is to combine them (e.g. backing this website with Google Drive storage).Â

## **Project Management:**

 I've investigated other tools (see [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15dMX34d_PpyEYzQvyLKUZnXXUfadhngyRhiX5Ox1p1s/edit?usp=sharing) for the rejects), but nothing else suited my needs. In particular, the above allow me to manage my project without project management being a project in itself.Â

## Task Management:

 Some of the principles used in making a decision on a task management tool: 

1. I should be able to see everything that is going on at a glance (i.e. visual controls)
2. [I should control what happens, not the system](http://robbiemitchell.com/post/91340724/basecamp-task-lists-vs-due-dates)
3. Reminders/scheduling is for my calendar

 When I first started looking for a task management tool, I focused on those that supported Kanban principlesÂ (see [this](http://agilelion.com/agile-kanban-cafe/open-kanban) for a good writeup of Kanban practices) as such a tracker has excellent visual controls. After searching around a bit (see the task management tab [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15dMX34d_PpyEYzQvyLKUZnXXUfadhngyRhiX5Ox1p1s/edit?usp=sharing) for rejects), I decided to use Kanbanize for this purpose.Â 

  

 While I have been very satisfied with Kanbanize as I product, in the end it has not served my purposes well. Because my typical workflow has Gmail and Google Calendar open, but not a separate tasks tracker, I would not have the tasks in front of my all the time, which led to me letting them slip.Â 

  

 Given that I lack the screen real-estate to display yet another application, I chose to consolidate my tasks into my Google Calendar window using Google Tasks. This way, everything is in front of me at all times. Even though there is a lot less functionality, I've found the greater visibility to be more than worth it - since making the switch, time to completion for tasks has dropped dramatically.Â

**Goal/Habit ManagementÂ** 

  

 I'm currently in the process of trying out HabitBull and so far things are going well. I chose this application because it was the only one I could find which worked on Android, had the ability to track yes/no and numerical completion, and had a good user interface.Â

**Time Management**  

  

 Over the last few years, I've used Google Calendar to schedule and track my time. I use different calendars for things like meetings and meals to make it easy to organize my time.Â
