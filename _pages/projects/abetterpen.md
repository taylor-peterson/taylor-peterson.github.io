I'm a self-professed pen and pencil snob. I strongly prefer extremely fine tips (~0.4 mm) and high quality, all-metal construction. In the mechanical pencil realm, there are some commercial offerings that have appeased me for the time being (namely, the Rotring 600). Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be a pen equivalent to these. While there are a number of cartridges in the 0.4 mm size range that work quite well, most come encased in plastic bodies and none of the metal-bodied ones are suitable. Fortunately for me, making a all-metal pen body is within my reach.
