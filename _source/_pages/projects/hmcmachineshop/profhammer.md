title: Prof Hammer
---

One day, when Sean and I were wandering the halls, we ran into Dean Jacobsen
(Professor of Mathematics and Dean of Students) outside of the machine shop and
Sean asked him if he had ever considered making a hammer (a traditional project
for engineering majors at Mudd). Turns out, he had always wanted to make one,
but never had the opportunity, so Sean and I offered to help him and any other
professors that might be interested.

The idea of teaching the professors and helping them make hammers got Sean and
I excited and we ran around inviting everyone we thought we be interested.
Turns out a lot of professors wanted to make hammers and quite a few shop
proctors were willing to help out! So we went to the engineering department and
pitched the idea. They approved, so off we went.

The always amusing Professor Saeta and his completed hammer.

In the end, only a handful of the original group (Profs Gokli, Saeta, and Yong)
finished their hammers, but we hope that more professors will get a chance to
make a hammer in the future.
