## Background

Personally, I do not like having caps on my pens (too easy to lose, two hand operation, etc.) and as such want a retractable pen. That said, traditional "clicky" pens annoy me with their noise. The only way I could think of making a quiet retractable pen (that could still be worked with one hand) was with a "bolt action" mechanism. Turns out that this design has been up and coming with the Kickstarter crowd and several versions have been made previously. For example, theÂ [TiBolt](http://jumpstartcity.com/events/tibolt-the-american-made-titanium-bolt-action-pen/c),Â [The Bolt](http://fromthepencup.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/the-bolt-a-machined-bolt-action-pen/), and theÂ [maxmadco retractable pen](http://maxmadco.com/products/retractable-pen/).Â 

  

However, all of these are rather expensive (\>$50) and might not be work well with the cartridges I prefer. As well, I am not a fan of certain characteristics of each: the TiBolt's finish looks too rough and the pen itself seems a little bulky (seeÂ [thisÂ](http://edcforums.com/threads/the-tibolt-compared-to-the-embassy-pen-and-now-the-madmaxco.105871/)comparison of it to the maxmadco); the Bolt's mechanism seems like it would be finicky/not very satisfying; the bolt on the maxmadco looks a little tacky given that it's just a screw.Â 

  

Given those concerns, I think it would be preferable to design my own pen. Of the three, I like the maxmadco one the best (I'd probably buy it and replace the bolt with something similar to the TiBolt if it cost about a third of what it did).Â 

## Design Requirements

- All components save the ink cartridgeÂ _mustÂ_ be made of metal
- The penÂ _mustÂ_ have a retractable design 
- The penÂ _mustÂ_ have a functional clip 
- The ink cartridgeÂ _mustÂ_ be replaceableÂ 
- All componentsÂ _mustÂ_ be manufacturable using HMC facilities 

- The penÂ _shouldÂ_ be approximately 5 inches in length 
- The penÂ _shouldÂ_ weigh approximately 1.5 ounces 
- The user of the penÂ _shouldÂ_ be awestruck
