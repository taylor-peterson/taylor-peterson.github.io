# Walden

I almost finished the first chapter of Thoreau's "masterpiece", Walden, before
putting the book down in disgust. Although widely regarded as a "classic"
containing influential ideas, those key ideas are better acquired from
alternate sources.

Thoreau is pretentious, privileged, judgemental, hypocritical, disingenuous,
and otherwise insufferable.

There is [an excellent article](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum)
in "The New Yorker" which goes into greater detail on "Henry David Thoreau's moral myopia."

Walden's key ideas of living simply and respecting nature would be better
picked up by reading the Stoics and spending some time in nature yourself.
