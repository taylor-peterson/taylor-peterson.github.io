title: Supersonic Rocket
---

E80: Experimental Engineering, is one of the key classes in the Engineering
curriculum at Mudd. It is a sophomore-level, lab-based course that covers a
variety of engineering disciplines. The final project for this course is an
open-ended, experimental project in which students are asked to use what they
have learned to design an experiment, take data, and analyze some aspect of
rocket flight. My team decided to go above and beyond the standard project and
make a supersonic rocket.

A full write-up of the project (including links to all of our reports and
proposals) can be found [over on Sean's
