After looking at existing pens, I came up with a list of major design decisions to be made:

- Stainless Steel vs. Aluminum
- Tapered vs. Drafting-style tip (by drafting-style I mean like the [Rotring 600](http://cdn.coloradopen.com/images/uploads/rotring-600-pencil-POP.png) or like [these pens](http://coolmaterial.com/gear/apollo-technical-pen-and-drafting-scale/))
- Cylindrical vs. Hexagonal body
- Single vs. multi-piece body
- Replaceable vs. sealed end
- Knurled vs. smooth grip

I currently prefer the first of each set. The reasons for this are as follows:

- I have a big chunk of stainless which could be heat-treated to gold should we desire. As such, I could do silver or gold whereas with aluminum I could only have silver (realistically, I'm not going to pay for anodizing). Although aluminum would be easier to machine.
- The drafting-style tip does increase visibility to the page, but I think the tapered tip looks better overall and that visibility shouldn't be an issue.
- While I do like the hexagonal body of the Rotring pencils, a hexagonal body would require additional machining operations (aka more time) and a change in body geometry between the shaft and grip area (which might not look the best).
- I initially thought of having the body be a single piece with a slot at the top to allow the bolt to slide out and the cartridge to be replaced. However, I think that that design would allow for the bolt to be lost and would complicate fabrication.
- Although I don't anticipate needing a stylus nub or anything similar anytime soon, it wouldn't too much more work to give us that option. 
- While the smooth grip might look sleeker, I think the extra grip of a knurled grip would be appreciated.

In summary, I'm thinking of a pen with the following component breakdown: 

- Bolt and bolt carriage similar to the [TiBolt](http://jumpstartcity.com/events/tibolt-the-american-made-titanium-bolt-action-pen/c)
- Clip and clip screws similar to any of the above
- Body similar to the [maxmadco](http://maxmadco.com/products/retractable-pen/), but with knurling on the grip and a replaceable tip like the TiBolt as opposed to unscrewing at the middle.
- Replaceable end like on the TiBolt but with the bevel like on the maxmadco. 

As I move on to the detailed design stage, these decisions may be changed.
