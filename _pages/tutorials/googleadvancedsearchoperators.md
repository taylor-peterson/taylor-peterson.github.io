---

The below information is pruned down the [original source.](http://www.sourcinghacks.com/google-search-operators-and-more/) 

| **Search within a specific site or domain**  

_site:_

| Use the **site:**  operator to search for information within a specific website or type of site (.org, .edu). 

[ **site:** linkedin.com] or [ **site:** edu]

| **Placeholder**  / **Fill in the blank**

_query \* query_

| Use an asterisk (\*) as a placeholder for any unknown or â€œwildcardâ€ terms. Results will vary depending on its use, how Google has indexed the content of the page or what Google feels is relevant. 

["senior \* recruiter"] will include results for [senior **technical**  recruiter]

["senior \* \* recruiter"] will include results for [senior **interactive marketing**  recruiter]

| **Search for a specific term within the Title of a website**

_intitle:_

| Place **intitle:**  immediately in front of your query to search for a specific term or phrase within the Title of a website or page. 

[ **intitle:** resume] or [ **intitle:**"resume software engineer"]

| **Search for terms within the URL of a website**

_inurl:_

| Search for a specific term or terms within the URL of a website. 

[ **inurl:** resume]

**_Tip:_**  The query must be a complete or whole term, meaning that you cannot extract a term from a string of consecutive letters or numbers.

| **Search for pages with links**

_link:_

| Use the **link:**  operator to search websites or pages that contain links to another page or website. 

[ **link:** google.com]

| **Search by file type**

_filetype:_

| Use the **filetype:**  operator to search for specific types of files, such as PDFs, DOCs, or XLS 

[ **filetype:** pdf]

| **\Find related websites**

_related:_

| Use the **related:**  operator to find sites that have similar content by typing **related:**  immediately in front of a website URL. 

**[related:**jigsaw.com]

| **Exclude a word or phrase**  

_-query_

| Add a dash (-) immediately in front of a word to exclude all results that include that word. 

[-job -jobs]

You can also exclude results based on other operators, like excluding all results from a specific site.

[developer -site:linkedin.com]

| **Include similar words with the Tilde**  

_~query_

| At times, Google _may_ replace some words in your original search query with synonyms. To tell Google that you want synonyms included, add a tilde sign (~) immediately in front of a word to search for that word as well as synonyms. 

[ software ~engineer] will also include results for [software developer]

| **Search for all words**

_query query_

_query AND query_

| To search for pages that need to have all words, include AND (capitalized) or a space between the words. Google assumes AND when there is simply a space between terms. 

[software engineer "seattle washington"] or [software AND engineer AND "seattle washington"]

| **Search for either word**

_query | query_

_query OR query_

| To search for pages that need to have only one of several words, include OR (capitalized) or a pipe (|) between the words. 

[software engineer seattle | "san francisco"] or [software engineer seattle OR "san francisco"]

| **Search for a number range**  

_number..number_

| Separate numbers by two periods (with no spaces) to see results that contain numbers in a given range. 

[50..300 connections]

**_Tip:_**  Use only one number with the two periods to indicate an upper maximum or a lower minimum.
