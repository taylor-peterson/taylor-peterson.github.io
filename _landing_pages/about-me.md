Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.

Wait... that's not right. My name's actually Taylor Peterson. My father is
doing quite well. And the only thing you have to prepare yourself for is
_awesomeness_. Because that's pretty much all you're going to find
on this website.

So about me. I'm a robotics aficionado with a lifelong love of learning. I
graduated with a double major in Engineering and Computer Science from Harvey
Mudd College and currently work with Amazon Prime Air.

When I'm not at work, you can usually find me working on a project, riding a bike,
flying on the trapeze rig, eating, sleeping, ...

Enough about me, check out the rest of the site to see what I've been up to
lately.
