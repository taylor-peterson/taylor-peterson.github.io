 This page will contain the tips and tricks I am picking up in building this site. See below for miscellany; see the left bar for more involved write-ups.Â 

- As of when I created this site, Google Sites did not support LaTeX, nor did it have any plans to do so.Â [Workaround](http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php)!Â 
- The slideshow on my home page was based on [this tutorial](http://www.steegle.com/websites/google-sites-howtos/docs-presentation-slider-gadget).
