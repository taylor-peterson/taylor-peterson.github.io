title: Bicycle Frame
---

Ever since I started working with composites, I've wanted to make a bicycle
frame. Unfortunately, I currently don't have access to suitable tubing (the
commercial tubing I can buy doesn't have the right layup schedule). As such,
this project is on hold until the Filament Winder is complete and I can make my
own custom tubes.

That said, I hope to build a beauty similar to the Seven Cycles frame shown
below.

Reason for deferring further:

- Cost (time and equipment) to do it right is too high - I'd be better off just
buying a bike and spending that time/effort on other things
-
  - Would have to model the bike frame and then actually make it
  - Making it would require filament winder and 3D CNC and lots of pain
  - Then I would have to test it which would require expensive or custom-made
  machines

Progress:

- Just the preliminary research as seen below
