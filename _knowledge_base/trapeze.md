Hollow body hold exercise: https://www.getcircusstrong.com/exercises-every-aerialist-should-do-the-problem-with-the-hollow-body/

When hanging: From there, if you’re going to hang from something, the next
piece of the puzzle involves making your shoulders stable. To do this, you need
to focus on screwing your shoulders into their sockets. That’s right: pull
yourself together. No passive hanging from stuff. Ever. Normally, I’d suggest
thinking of rotating your armpits forward and ‘breaking’ the bar with your
hands, but hypermobility warrants the additional consideration of actively
pulling in while gravity is pulling down.
The point here is that hanging from things must always be active. If you find
that it’s tiring, then that’s your cue to include things like hanging shoulder
retractions in your warm-up (one to two sets of ten to twelve repetitions).

90/90 belly breathing
Find a wall or mat or bench and lie on your back with your knees and hips bent to 90 degrees.
Put one hand on your stomach and one hand on your chest. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Take a couple of breaths to focus on having your stomach rise first, expanding up and out to the sides (a 360-degree breath, if you will). We’re aiming for little to no movement of your chest.
Once you’ve got that, breathe in through your nose and exhale forcefully through your mouth. Purse your lips and blow out all of the air in your lungs.
Notice the way this reflexively contracts your core and locks your ribs down, closer to the top of your pelvis. This is your ‘neutral’ rib position.
Now, press your legs into the wall/matt/bench and lift your butt about two inches off the floor. Hold it there for 5 full breaths.
Lower your butt back to the floor and do one more full breath.
For either variation, each successive forceful exhalation should feel like your ribcage is locking down into position. The importance of this position cannot be overstated. This represents the neutral (lumbar) spinal position and core muscular engagement that is the key to hip and shoulder mobility and your ability to transmit/absorb/generate force.

Shoulder (rotator cuff) warmup exercises for before flying
Arm circles: https://youtu.be/afjc4BowcGo
building up to making tight, fast circles overhead challenges your rotator cuff muscles to do their job and keep your humeral head in position was your arms move.
Rythmic Stabilizations: https://youtu.be/hSvdDR_RKHc
These are a great warm up exercise that will really get your brain-to-muscle connection firing! Remember, the point is not to fatigue your rotator cuff. Only do this for about fifteen seconds or less. And make sure your partner is being appropriately gentle—if you can hear the hand slapping your arm, that’s too much force.

Be tight! https://www.getcircusstrong.com/good-news-for-flyers-you-dont-have-to-be-tight/
If you’re doing a warm-up swing, use your first swing to focus only on
squeezing your butt, your quads, your core, etc. –and not on the swing itself.
Just get up in the air and think only about being tight. And see what happens.
You might find yourself with focus to spare, so you can do a gentle swing—but
do not stop focusing on being tight.

Sit down on the floor with your legs straight and together.
Point your toes.
Squeeze your quads (your thigh muscles) really tight.
Squeeze your butt really tight.
Activate the muscles of your pelvic floor. This helps you create a zipped up feeling. (These are the muscles you use to ‘hold it’ when you have to pee).
Activate your transverse abdominus (it’s the muscle that wraps around you stomach and is a very important muscle for core stabilization). Think of pulling your belly button in towards your spine.
Hold this position.
Start with 5 seconds and work your way up to 30 seconds. As you begin to feel more confident with holding this position, you can gradually lean yourself back into a ‘hollow’ position (think ‘banana shape’).
Ideally, you should be contracting all of these muscles this tightly the whole time you are in the air.

Having trouble contracting your glute without feeling like your hamstring is about to spasm?
https://www.getcircusstrong.com/stretching-down-the-rabbit-hole/
Lie on the floor with your knees bent, feet flat.
Pull one knee up toward your chest and hold it there with your hands.
This part is important: Exhale fully and forcefully to engage your core and lock your rib cage into position.
Lift the toes of the foot that’s still on the floor. Drive through your heel to lift your hips toward the ceiling without losing that core engagement. Your torso should move as one piece.
Repeat eight times each side.
Please note: if your hip flexors are indeed tight, you are not likely to end up extending your hip all the way. That’s fine. It’s just a sign that you need to work on this: use this as an exercise to help your glutes fire and to help your hip flexors get the message that they can settle down.
You may also find that your hamstrings feel like they are working way too hard. It just means they’re trying to do the job your glutes should be doing. That’s ok too, because doing this drill helps that to get better.

First, lie on the floor on your back with your arms out in front of you and your hips and knees bent to a 90 degree angle. (Point your toes. This is circus, after all.)
Press your lower back against the floor. Your job throughout this exercise will be to keep your lower back pressed firmly against the floor.
Inhale through your nose and press your lower back into the floor.
As you exhale, lower one arm and the opposite leg slowly towards the floor. Only go as far as you can without allowing your lower back to arch and come off the floor. Exhale fully at the bottom of each rep.
Slowly return to the starting position and then repeat with the opposite arm/leg.
The key to benefitting from this exercise lies in being strict with your form and making your movements slow and controlled.
Include one or two sets of 6-8 repetitions per side in your warm-up (both before you train/fly and before you workout).

Gripping the bar

When you grab the bar, make sure your pinky knuckle is on top of the bar with your thumb wrapped over your index and middle fingers.
Think elbows and armpits forward and/or think about “breaking the bar” with your hands.
