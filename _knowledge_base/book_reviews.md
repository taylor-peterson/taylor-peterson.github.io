# So Good They Can't Ignore You - Cal Newport

The main point of this book is that "following your passion" is bull and that
mastering rare and valuable skills is a better path to a successful and fulfilling
career. Whether you love your work or not is mostly based on expertise and experience,
so your particular career choice is much less important than leveraging deliberate
practice to become an expert.

This approach roughly mirrors my preceeding outlook coming in (in part because I had
read Cal's Craftsman post several years prior). The book also does not
have much in the way of actionable takeaways, so I didn't get a ton out of it.

# Walden - Henry David Thoreau

I almost finished the first chapter of Thoreau's "masterpiece", Walden, before
putting the book down in disgust. Although widely regarded as a "classic"
containing influential ideas, those key ideas are better acquired from
alternate sources.

Thoreau is pretentious, privileged, judgemental, hypocritical, disingenuous,
and otherwise insufferable.

There is [an excellent article](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum)
in "The New Yorker" which goes into greater detail on "Henry David Thoreau's moral myopia."

Walden's key ideas of living simply and respecting nature would be better
picked up by reading the Stoics and spending some time in nature yourself.
