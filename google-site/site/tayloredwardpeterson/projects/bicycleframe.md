# Bicycle Frame

| 
  

 | 

Ever since I started working with composites, I've wanted to make a bicycle frame. Unfortunately, I currently don't have access to suitable tubing (the commercial tubing I can buy doesn't have the right layup schedule). As such, this project is on hold until the Filament Winder is complete and I can make my own custom tubes.Â 

  

That said, I hope to build a beauty similar to the Seven Cycles frame shown below.

 Reason for deferring further: 

- Cost (time and equipment) to do it right is too high - I'd be better off just buying a bike and spending that time/effort on other things
- 
  - Would have to model the bike frame and then actually make it
  - Making it would require filament winder and 3D CNC and lots of pain
  - Then I would have to test it which would require expensive or custom-made machines

 Progress:Â 

- Just the preliminaryÂ researchÂ as seen below
