During my senior year, I was a member of a four person HMC CS clinic team
working with Qualcomm Research. We were responsible for designing and building
a robotic tour guide to demonstrate the capabilities of the Snapdragon 600
processor in a mobile robotics context. At the end of the year, our modified
TurtleBot2 was capable of autonomously guiding visitors through Mudd's Libra
Complex - the notoriously labyrinthine underground complex containing most of
Mudd's labs.

I was the project manager for the team and as such was responsible for keeping
the whole team on track.

I was also lead for localization and hardware modifications. In this role, I
successfully generated maps of the entire environment, tuned and augmented the
ROS navigation stack to allow the TurtleBot2 to navigate those maps, and
modified the TurtleBot2 to work with the Snapdragon 600 and other additions.
