This was used for the tip production run during the week of May 11, 2015. 

Tooling:
    Tool #1 is a right-hand cutting bit. 
    Tool #6 is a parting insert in an grooving tool(for greater rigidity). 

Events:
    The first cycle machines the taper and part of the diameter. 
    The second cycle reduces the rest of the diameter. 
    The third cycle starts the smaller diameter for the threads. 
    The first turn operation cleans up the corner transition between the two diameters. 
    The final turn operation parts off the piece. 

Origin:
    One end of the carriage. 
    Rotational axis. 

Setup:
    The space between the tip of the left-hand cutting bit and the left edge of its tool holder is 1/4".
    Move the carriage to -0.25", then feed the stock forward until it is flush with the edge of the tool holder.
