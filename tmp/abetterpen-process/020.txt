This was used for the carriage production run during the week of May 11, 2015.

Tooling:
    Tool #1 is a right-hand cutting bit.
    Tool #6 is a parting insert in an grooving tool(for greater rigidity).

Events:
    The first cycle rounds off one end of the carriage.
    The second cycle reduces the rest of the diameter.
    The next turn operation creates a relief for the following arc operation which rounds off the other end.
    The final turn operation parts off the piece.

Origin:
    One end of the carriage.
    Rotational axis.

Setup:
    The space between the tip of the left-hand cutting bit and the left edge of its tool holder is 1/4".
    Move the carriage to -0.25", then feed the stock forward until it is flush with the edge of the tool holder.
