# Digital "Bookshelf"

  

| 
  

 | 
 I read quite a bit (although much less than I used to and on much different topics). Some of those books stand out from the others. And some of those really influence me or have otherwise made a mark on me. Those special books earn a place on this digital bookshelf.Ã‚ 
  

 Also music and videos! 

  

- In Her Name 
- Honor Harrington
